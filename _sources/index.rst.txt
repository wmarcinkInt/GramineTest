Gramine is a lightweight guest OS that's designed to run a single Linux
application with minimal host requirements. Gramine can run applications in an
isolated environment with benefits comparable to running a complete OS in a
virtual machine, including guest customization, ease of porting to
different host OSs, and process migration.

Gramine supports running Linux applications using the Intel Software Guard Extensions, or Intel SGX. Refer to the :doc:`sgx-intro`.
